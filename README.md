# `DaemonZero` (DZ)

### The Modern Evolution of Agentic AI

</div>

DaemonZero (DZ) is a modernized fork of the agentic framework formerly known as Agent Zero. It is designed to be a robust, feature-rich, and autonomous AI system that grows and learns with you.

## 🚀 What is DaemonZero?

DaemonZero is a general-purpose personal assistant that uses your computer as a tool. It is not pre-programmed for specific tasks but is designed to be dynamic, organically growing, and transparent.

### Key Features
- **General-purpose Assistant**: Gathers information, executes commands, writes code, and cooperates with other agents.
- **Computer as a Tool**: Uses the OS, terminal, and browser to accomplish tasks.
- **Persistent Memory**: Learns from past interactions to solve future tasks faster.
- **Multi-agent Cooperation**: Orchestrates subordinate agents for complex tasks.
- **Totally Customizable**: Defined by system prompts and open architecture.

## 🔮 Future Direction

We are actively working on:
- **Centralized Management**: A unified launcher and manager (DZ Manager) for handling instances and dependencies.
- **Enhanced Stability**: Improved error handling and robust configuration management.
- **Modern UI/UX**: A cleaner, more intuitive interface for managing your agents.
- **Performance**: Optimized resource usage and faster response times.

## ⚙️ Installation & Usage

*(Detailed installation instructions coming soon. Check `manager/` folder for the new launcher)*

### Quick Start (Docker)
```bash
docker pull agent0ai/agent-zero  # (Temporary upstream image)
docker run -p 50001:80 agent0ai/agent-zero
```
