# `DaemonZero` (DZ)

### The Modern Daemon: Personal, Autonomous, Organic

</div>

DaemonZero (DZ) is a modernized fork of the DaemonZero framework. Our philosophy is rooted in the concept of the "Modern Daemon" – a background process that is always active, learning, and ready to serve, yet fully under the user's control.

## 🌌 Philosophy & Intent

### 1. **Complete Autonomy, Zero Friction**
We believe that advanced AI should be as easy to deploy as a classic system daemon. DaemonZero is designed to handle its own environment, prerequisites, and lifecycle. The **DZ Manager** is the single hub for this vision, providing a unified setup and orchestration experience.

### 2. **Organic Learning**
DZ is not a static tool. It is an organic agent that remembers past tasks, improves its own codebase, and adapts its strategies based on successful outcomes stored in its persistent memory.

### 3. **Transparency over Magic**
Everything in DZ – from prompts to tool implementations – is readable and modifiable. We prioritize system transparency so that power users can audit and refine every cognitive step the agent takes.

### 4. **Computer as the Primary Workspace**
Unlike sandbox-heavy frameworks, DZ treats the host OS as its primary workspace. It uses terminal, browser, and file system tools to bridge the gap between AI reasoning and real-world execution.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Unified Manager**: One-click setup (Docker, deps, shortcuts) for Linux and eventually Windows.
- **Smart Orchestration**: Seamless multi-agent collaboration with a clear hierarchy.
- **Persistent Memory**: Vector-based recall that grows with every interaction.
- **Extensible Instruments**: Easy framework for adding custom, complex tools.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### The Easy Way (Verified on Linux & Ubuntu)
DaemonZero is designed to be self-configuring. Simply run the launcher script:

**Linux:**
```bash
./run.sh
```

**Windows:**
```batch
run.bat
```
*The Manager will automatically detect missing dependencies like Docker and guide you through the setup.*

## 📦 Standalone Releases
For the ultimate experience, download the standalone binary from our **Releases** section. No Python installation required.

## 🤝 Roadmap

- [ ] Complete Windows support in DZ Manager.
- [ ] Centralized Secrets Management (Provider-level).
- [ ] Advanced Web-based Multi-instance Control Center.
- [ ] Native Browser-use integration v2.
